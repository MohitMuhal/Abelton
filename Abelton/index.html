        <p>
          Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a
          community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

          Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly
          rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what
          we make, and the people we make it for.

          We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our
          offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from
          a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of
          us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and
          knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

          We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work on a few products and we
          strive to make them great.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic
          and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and
          thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but
          opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

          Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
          skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
          salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

          If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free
          German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for
          you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s
          not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun,
          informal small-group activities.
